## 5.1

This release includes the following new features

- UI: You can now create an overlay UI that opens on your scene. See x for details, or x for a working example.

- Improved audio engine: Multiple audio samples can be played at once. Also, each audio sample has a specific location. See x details, or x for a working example.

This version includes several bug fixes and optimizations. It also includes the following changes:

- 3D model animations are now handled by an `Animator` component, instead of by the `GLTFModel` component.

  ```ts

  ```

  Also reset

  ```
  ```

  Also on end event

  ```
  ```

  Also animationClip objects renamed?

    See x for details

- Billboard mode is now done via a separate specialized component, instead of by setting a property in shape components.

  ```ts

  ```

    See x for details

- Each parcel now measures 16 x 16 meters. This was decided via a vote by the community. New scenes created with the CLI are 16 x 16, old scenes remain as 10 x 10, but we recommend migrating to a 16 x 16 format. Scene limitations per each parcel haven't changed since 5.0.

- Basic commands for handling components are renamed for more clarity.

add   addComponent

etc


- Limit checks for bounding boxes in 3D models
